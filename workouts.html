                Hi, I am Andez, the one taking the picture, and beside me are my 2 long-term clients Timothy (left) and Jasper (Right). I provide a home-based personal training service for all interested individuals who wish to get that bulk or lose that bit of weight. I once was a very scrawny looking boy, feeling very insecure about my body and how my peers looked compared to me. But it is important to know that you are who you are, and whatever body you want to get and want to live in is entirely down to you! So don't look down on yourself, and work hard to achieve that ideal figure that you so crave. I call my team of clients "The Pack" because we lions stick together and help each other in tough times. The only tough day was yesterday when you are over here, so we need people who we can share this camaraderie with over here. I, myself have a Sports Science & Management Degree, am personal training certified, and also have a real passion in football since young. I specialise in endurance training, HIIT and also weight training. Besides training over here, I encourage my clients to train in their own respective gyms to get that extra pump and try to break their PBs every week. As the leader of "The Pack", I strive to get the best out of my team/clients, and I will always give my 100% to achieve the results that my team wants! There are no shortcuts in life, so to end off: There is no pain nor gain, just keep your head down and train.

                <h5>
                    Using these 2 videos as examples, I will get Timothy to send me some of videos of his own workout. This way, I can analyse his form along with his technique, and then provide feedback whenever he comes for his personalized session with me. This is highly encouraged as it not only allows you to get more work done, but it enables me to help my team out whenever I can. The leader of the pack will never look past anybody's problems.

                <h5>
                    These 2 videos are slightly different, as they show Jasper going for his new PB record for both squats and deadlift. In "The Pack", we strive to be the best version of ourselves everyday, and we seek improvement in all areas. As the leader, I will always give my all to help the team out, and when someone achieves an extraordinary result, we celebrate together as a team. Jasper's PB was not just achieved with my help, but also his persevearance and sheer hard work that pushed him through. I am extremely proud of him, and I'm sure my clients, whether present or future, will achieve this one day. "The Pack" never stops hunting.
